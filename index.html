            Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate, industrial designer and engineer.
            [3] He is the founder, CEO, CTO and chief designer of SpaceX; early investor,[b] CEO and product architect of Tesla, 
            Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. 
            He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[6][7] Also that year, he was ranked 25th on the 
            Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[8] and was ranked joint-first on the Forbes list of the Most 
            Innovative Leaders of 2019.[9] A centi-billionaire,[10] Musk became the richest person in the world in January 2021.[11]
            Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended 
            the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred 
            to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. 
            He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University, 
            but dropped out after two days to pursue a business career. He co-founded Zip2, a web software company, which was 
            acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, 
            which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.
            In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. 
            He joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, 
            becoming its product architect that year and its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services 
            company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly 
            artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer 
            interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels 
            optimized for electric vehicles. In addition to his primary business pursuits, he envisioned an open-source high-speed 
            transportation system known as the Hyperloop based on the concept of a vactrain.
            Musk has also been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. 
            Following the rejection of a prototype submarine from Tesla that Musk had offered to be used in the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, 
            he called a diver who advised in the rescue and disparaged the prototype a "pedo guy" and in response the diver sued for defamation;
            a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. Also in 2018, he falsely tweeted that he had secured funding for a private 
            takeover of Tesla at $420 a share. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for the comment; he temporarily 
            stepped down from chairman and settled with the SEC; the settlement included limitations on his Twitter usage. 
            Musk has received substantial criticism for his views on artificial intelligence, public transportation, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

            SpaceX
          </div>
          <div class="about__text-1">
            Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company 
            headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation 
            costs to enable the colonization of Mars.[9][10][11] SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, as well as the Dragon 
            cargo spacecraft and the Starlink satellite constellation (providing internet access), and has flown humans to the 
            International Space Station on the SpaceX Dragon 2.
            SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008,[12] 
            the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company 
            to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012),[13] the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive 
            landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), the first to launch 
            a private spacecraft into orbit around the Sun (Falcon Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018), and the first private 
            company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 and SpaceX Crew-1
            missions in 2020).[14] As of 31 December 2020, SpaceX has flown 20 [15][16] cargo resupply missions to the International 
            Space Station (ISS) under a partnership with NASA,[17] as well as an uncrewed demonstration flight of the human-rated Dragon 
            2 spacecraft (Crew Dragon Demo-1) on 2 March 2019, and the first crewed Dragon 2 flight on 30 May 2020.[14]
            In December 2015, a Falcon 9 accomplished a propulsive vertical landing. This was the first such achievement by a rocket for 
            orbital spaceflight.[18] In April 2016, with the launch of SpaceX CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically landed the first stage
            on an ocean drone ship landing platform.[19] In May 2016, in another first, SpaceX again landed the first stage, but during a 
            significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) mission.[20] In March 2017, SpaceX became the first to successfully 
            re-launch and land the first stage of an orbital rocket.[21] In January 2020, with the third launch of the Starlink project, 
            SpaceX became the largest commercial satellite constellation operator in the world.[22][23]
            In September 2016, Musk unveiled the Interplanetary Transport System — subsequently renamed Starship — a privately funded launch 
            system to develop spaceflight technology for use in crewed interplanetary spaceflight. In 2017, Musk unveiled an updated 
            configuration of the system which is intended to handle interplanetary missions plus become the primary SpaceX orbital 
            vehicle after the early 2020s, as SpaceX has announced it intends to eventually replace its existing Falcon 9 launch vehicles 
            and Dragon space capsule fleet with Starship, even in the Earth-orbit satellite delivery market.[24][25][26]:24:50–27:05 
            Starship is planned to be fully reusable and will be the largest rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.

            Tesla Motors
          </div>
          <div class="about__text-1">
            Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.) is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, 
            California. Tesla's current products include electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid scale, solar panels 
            and solar roof tiles, as well as other related products and services.
            Founded in July 2003 as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk, 
            who contributed most of the funding in the early days, has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to 
            help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power.[10][11]            
            Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling plug-in and battery electric passenger car manufacturer in 2019, with a market share 
            of 17% of the plug-in segment and 23% of the battery electric segment. Tesla global vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, 
            a 35.8% increase over the previous year.[12] In 2020, the company surpassed the 1 million mark of electric cars produced.[13] 
            The Model 3 ranks as the world's all-time best-selling plug-in electric car, with more than 500,000 delivered.[14] 
            Through its subsidiary SolarCity, Tesla develops and is a major installer of solar photovoltaic systems in the United States. 
            Tesla is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, from home-scale to grid-scale. Tesla installed 
            some of the largest battery storage plants in the world and supplied 1.65 GWh of battery storage in 2019.            
            Tesla has been the subject of numerous lawsuits and controversies, arising from the statements and the conduct of CEO Elon Musk,
             allegations of whistleblower retaliation, alleged worker rights violations, and allegedly unresolved and dangerous technical 
             problems with their products. Tesla has been one of the most shorted companies in history.

            The Boring Company
          </div>
          <div class="about__text-1">
            The Boring Company (also known as TBC)[2][3] is an American infrastructure and tunnel construction services company 
            founded by Elon Musk. Its current and proposed projects are designed for loop intra-city transit systems although the 
            company has stated that the Hawthorne test tunnel can support Hyperloop R&D and that current tunnels are being built 
            so they could support eventual transition to Hyperloop-based transportation on longer inter-city routes.[4][5]
            TBC has completed one tunnel for testing Hyperloop and Loop in Los Angeles County, and it has another tunnel under 
            construction in Las Vegas for Loop. Two further tunnels are pending permitting, with one connecting Washington D.C. 
            to Baltimore designed for both Loop and Hyperloop, and another tunnel connecting Dodger Stadium to the rest of 
            Los Angeles with Loop.[4]           
            Musk cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and what he sees as limitations with the current two-dimensional 
            transportation network as his early inspiration for the project.[3][6] The Boring Company was initially formed 
            as a subsidiary of SpaceX, becoming a separate and fully independent company in 2018. As of December 2018, 90% of 
            the equity was owned by Musk,[7] with 6% held by SpaceX in return for the use of SpaceX resources during the initial 
            startup of the company.[8] Outside investments during 2019 have changed the equity split.

            Neuralink Corporation is an American neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and others, developing implantable 
            brain–machine interfaces (BMIs). The company's headquarters are in San Francisco;[6] it was started in 2016 and was 
            first publicly reported in March 2017.[1][2]
            Since its founding, the company has hired several high-profile neuroscientists from various universities.[7] By July 2019, 
            it had received $158 million in funding (of which $100 million was from Musk) and was employing a staff of 90 employees.
            [8] At that time, Neuralink announced that it was working on a "sewing machine-like" device capable of implanting very thin 
            (4 to 6 μm in width[9]) threads into the brain, and demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat via 1,500 electrodes, 
            anticipating to start experiments with humans in 2020.[8]            
            Some claims made by Musk in relation to the technology have been criticized by several neuroscientists and publications,

            <div class="news__text">
              Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers 
              and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after 
              obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through 
              compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States.
